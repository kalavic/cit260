        <h1>Weekly Reflections</h1>
        <p>This page is dedicated to reflecting on the things that I am learning in my CIT 261 class at BYU-Idaho.</p>
        <h2>Course Introduction</h2>
        <p>This week was fairly simple. I think that the most difficult part of online classes is orienting myself to find all of the assignments and information (since each teacher organizes things a little differently this can sometimes be confusing). I enjoyed getting to know the software a little bit more, even though I’ve used quite a bit of it previously. I’m not 100% fluent in any of it, but I understand how most of it works and can get the basic understanding from it. I’m excited for the opportunity to use this course to continue to grow in those skills.</p>
        <h2>Lesson 01</h2>
        <p>This week was actually quite a fun week. I did some brainstorming for the app that I want to create, and I came up with a lot of really interesting ideas. The more I looked into what each might need and how the data going into it would affect my overall project, I was able to narrow down my ideas until I had one that I thought would be good to learn from but that would also be interesting and fun to work on. The artistic aspect has always been my favorite, so I’m enjoying the process of brainstorming and coming up with ways to combine both the development of an app with the design of one.</p>
        <h2>Lesson 02</h2>
        <p>Communication is really important. If you have to make a schedule change for a meeting or if we need to set a time to meet, please do it early rather than a few hours beforehand. It makes it really difficult to coordinate and get things done when we are all depending on one another if there is a lack of communication. And since this is an online class and our collaboration is all based on virtual chats and emailing it's even more important that everyone stay on top of the communication and coordination of meetings.</p>
        <p>Communication is something that I’m really worried about for this class because I can’t be flexible with my schedule unless I’m told ahead of time what my team needs and wants to see happen during the week. I hope that things work out and the semester will go smoothly.</p>
        <h2>Lesson 03</h2>
        <p>This week I was working on learning coding for JSON and Javascript. It was really confusing most of the time, but I found a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp">resource</a> that made it a lot easier to understand Javascript Objects.  After going through the examples and information, I understood the coding a lot better.</p>
